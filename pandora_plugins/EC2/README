Amazon EC2 CloudWatch monitoring
--------------------------------

This specific monitoring uses CloudWatch API to monitor your instances
in Amazon EC2 service. You need to have activated the cloudwatch
enabled in your instance.

The main idea of this remote server plugin is to get information from
your instances using the network plugin server, that means you will
need to register the plugin in the server, and make different modules
to grab the information of your EC2 servers.

This is an example of the execution:

   ./ec2_cloudwatch_plugin.sh -f ./ec2.conf -d InstanceId=i-9d0b4af1 -n AWS/EC2 -m CPUUtilization

It will return a % numeric value of the metric "CPUUtilization" in the
instance i-9d0b4af1

For AWS/EC2 namespace, you can use -i option instead -d, like;

   ./ec2_cloudwatch_plugin.sh -f ./ec2.conf -i i-9d0b4af1 -n AWS/EC2 -m CPUUtilization

	***		***		***

This package also includes ec2_describe_instance.sh to get some
information about EC2 intances.

For example, you can get the AMI Id of the instance, by the command
below;

   ./ec2_describe_instance.sh -f ./ec2.conf -i i-9d0b4af1 -n ami-id

You can get the following information by this command;

    ami-id
    public-dns
    private-dns
    type
    available-zone
    public-ip
    private-ip
    block-devices
    security-group


To install you will need:
-------------------------

1. To have a running JAVA setup, and now its JAVA home directory. In
   the Pandora FMS Appliance (Vmware/Image) is set in /usr/

2. Put the whole package on a dir in the server, for example:

   /usr/share/pandora_server/util/plugin/ec2/

3. Create a Credential file. This package includes a template file
   Credential.template.

4. Set the following variables in the configuration file 'ec2.conf'.

4.1 AWS_CLOUDWATCH_HOME

  Set the path of Cloudwatch Command Line Tools, that is located at
  CloudWatch subdirectory in this package. Foe example, you may set
  it;

    AWS_CLOUDWATCH_HOME=/usr/share/pandora_server/util/plugin/ec2/CloudWatch

4.2 EC2_HOME

  Set the path of EC2 API Tools, that is located at ec2-api-tools
  subdirectory in this package. You may set it;

    EC2_HOME=/usr/share/pandora_server/util/plugin/ec2/ec2-api-tools

4.3 EC2_REGION

  Set the region that the targets belong to. This is used to specify
  'CloundWatch Monitoring URL' for CloudWatch API tools, and 'EC2 URL'
  for EC2 API tools. You may set it;

    EC2_REGION=ap-northeast-1

4.4 AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE

  Set the path of the Credential file. You may set it;

    AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE=/path-to/Credential.txt

5. If you have doubts about if it's correctly installed, execute
   directly this command:

    /path-to/ec2_cloudwatch_plugin.sh -f /path-to/ec2.conf -l

   should return something like;
--------------8<------------------------8<----------------
AWS/EBS  VolumeId=vol-65z53747  VolumeIdleTime
AWS/EBS  VolumeId=vol-65z53747  VolumeQueueLength
AWS/EBS  VolumeId=vol-65z53747  VolumeReadBytes
AWS/EBS  VolumeId=vol-65z53747  VolumeReadOps
AWS/EBS  VolumeId=vol-65z53747  VolumeTotalReadTime
AWS/EBS  VolumeId=vol-65z53747  VolumeTotalWriteTime
AWS/EBS  VolumeId=vol-65z53747  VolumeWriteBytes
AWS/EBS  VolumeId=vol-65z53747  VolumeWriteOps
AWS/EC2  InstanceId=i-9d0b4af1  CPUUtilization
AWS/EC2  InstanceId=i-9d0b4af1  DiskReadBytes
AWS/EC2  InstanceId=i-9d0b4af1  DiskReadOps
AWS/EC2  InstanceId=i-9d0b4af1  DiskWriteBytes
AWS/EC2  InstanceId=i-9d0b4af1  DiskWriteOps
AWS/EC2  InstanceId=i-9d0b4af1  NetworkIn
AWS/EC2  InstanceId=i-9d0b4af1  NetworkOut
AWS/EC2  InstanceId=i-9d0b4af1  StatusCheckFailed
AWS/EC2  InstanceId=i-9d0b4af1  StatusCheckFailed_Instance
AWS/EC2  InstanceId=i-9d0b4af1  StatusCheckFailed_System
----------------------------------------------------------

If you get such result, you're ready to use the plugin.
